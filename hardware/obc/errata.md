- Revision 1
    - U103 pin marking isn't visible with installed part / is under body
    - Too many components require manual rotation
    - From JLCPCB DFM review:
        - L101 doesn't fit; substituting 0806 inductor, XRNR201610,
          C5289252 for order
        - D501 is a pseudo SOD-123 in a power-optimized package but we have
          ordinary SOD-123 pads; substituting 1N5819HW-7-F p/n C82544 for
          order
