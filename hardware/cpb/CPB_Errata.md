- Revision 1  
    - RN components need proper fanout, some currently have vias in pads which causes marginal clearance.
    - Power Glitch needs to be fixed  
        - C5(22nF) needs to be moved between the gate and +VBATT rather than the gate and ground. (Electrically, everything should remain the same except
for the specified change above).  
    - Q3 doesn't have a base resistor and otherwise needs correction.  After lifting Q3, it is possible to program the microcontroller.
    - DAC outputs noisy.  Need better bypassing of 5V and possibly AVDD supply; consider layout improvements and guard rings.
    - DACs glitch at power up.  May be possible to address with power-up sequence (getting 3V3 going before 5V).
    - Power switches turn off pretty slow, inhibiting PWM.
        - R96 should be a smaller value-- perhaps 1/3rd the value to not waste too much power.
        - Select smaller output FET with lower gate charge.  DMP3098LSD has the same pinout and less than half the gate charge.
        - Between these two changes, we might "turn off" 7-8x as fast.
    - Need to rethink connector pinning.  Do we want to put a supply on ADC headers?
    - ENHANCEMENT: Consider adding a power LED for VM
    - ENHANCEMENT: GPLEDs (amber) could be brighter
    - Erroneous previous errata: Missing pullup for MAX22200 SDO.  MAX22200 SDO is open-drain and cannot drive pin high, but we have no pullup on pin.  (there was actually a pull-up).
- Revision A
    - Documentation: part number for RN2 was incorrect.  Using C93675 instead of the single 0603 that is in the BOM.
    - Documentation: 33 ohm resistors were ordered as C844927 due to shortfall of C844553.
    - Documentation: Some datasheet URLs in BOM were incorrect.
