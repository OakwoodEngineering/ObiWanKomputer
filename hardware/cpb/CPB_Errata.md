- Revision 1  
- RN component needs proper fanout, currently has vias too close to one
another which needs to change.  
- Power Glitch needs to be fixed  
- C5(22nF) needs to be moved between the gate and +VBATT rather than the
gate and ground. (Electrically, everything should remain the same except
for the specified change above).
